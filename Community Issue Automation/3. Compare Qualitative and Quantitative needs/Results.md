It was very difficult, even with Harvard's support, to obtain qualitative interviews with C levels within municipalities. While the sample size is smallish and we expect more variance, both the qualitative and quantitative results have some overlap.  This communicates there are consistent issues between what the leaders are noticing and the issues the community are submitting.  From my experience at the City of Tulsa, I knew these were an issue, but we now know there are similar issues across 30+ other cities in the country. 

In addition, it was noticed there were some differences between 311 calls and Leader priorities. This is partially to be expected due to politicians wanting to make an big impact instead of prioritizing being a good steward of tax dollars and wading through internal politics.  This is normal due to popularity defining their success and whether they will be reelected.  

When we asked the leaders if they would use a known mapping service, many said they already used this service and could see using a more proactive service.  The 311 calls expressed the needs of the community more directly.  Every call can be assigned a cost. Please see section four for the estimated cost per service.

Overall, we found a mix of big issues and common issues throughout the Qualitative data.  This data and the 311 data allowed us to define what data needed to be collected.  This gave us more confidence that a solution for these issues would have a large market and have value for the tax-payers and municipalities.
