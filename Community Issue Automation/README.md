# Overview
## Simplest Solution
The results show a complex problem.  The simplest solution is to just send out a certified letter($5) for each reported issue. However, from a City management perspective you won't know if there are actually issues and thus the high false positive rate applies.  While this would reduce a budget, it is not a high quality, trust worthy solution.

## AI
Computer vision has a lot of potential to further reduce the time in the field. With our 360 camera and much more data we would expect the reactive and proactive review rates to go beyond 90%.  This would further reduce the time in the field by an additional 25%.  The max we would expect to reduce the time in the field by is around 83.5%.  Our small budget of $12k wasn't enough to collect and annotate large amounts of data, but it was enough to show the efficacy of the approach.

## Fairness
All decisions would be human supervised, helping to make the model less biased and as fair as possible.  Without proper oversight, it could reinforce systemic issues.Fairness would need to be defined and governed by a governing body in each City.

## Driving Costs and ROI
While driving an entire City seems like a lot of work, the man power required to collect data every two weeks is a very small percentage of the neighborhood management budget.  We propose upto three four-hour shifts to collect the data. From our testing, four hours was the max safe driving time.  Having two vehicles driving twelve hours a day, five days a week, costs a City around $12000 in man-hours a month.  This sums to a total of $144k a year for a City the size of Tulsa.  This is about 12% of their neighborhood budget.  This still allows a tax-payer savings of around 40%.  This would amount to a savings of close to $480,000 for a City the size of Tulsa. We expect with more data and our 360 camera this savings to increase to around $750,000.

## Benefits
Having an exhaustive set of data provides more benefits than just reducing time in the field by 51.7%, it also allows for numerous other applications.  It applies to engineering, road, air quality, and other application.

## Privacy
Collecting monthly or bi-weekly allows the data to be specific, but not too specific. The nefarious applications are limited.  In addition, removing pii from the videos would also be completed, increasing safety.  While there is still a risk, proper processes and a governing body would significantly help privacy.

## Legal
From talking to multiple lawyers, street-view data is public in nature.  Anyone has the right to take a photo or video from a public road.  Otherwise, google would have issues.
