While the sample size is smallish and we expect larger variance, both the qualitative and quantitative results have some overlap.  This communicates there are consistent issues between what the leaders are noticing and the issues the community are submitting.  From my experience at the City of Tulsa, I knew these were an issue, but we now know there are similar issues across 20+ other cities in the country. This gave us more confidence that a solution to improve addressing these issues would have enough market.
