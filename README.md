# Research Overview
Process for validating qualitative and quantitative research that supports macro solutions to waste.

## Structure
Project/Approach folders/data


## Approach
### 1. Qualitative Needs Assessment 
* Design non-leading questions
* Interview leaders
* Compile trends

### 2. Quantitative Needs Assessment 
* Collect data
* Perform data analysis
* Review trends

### 3. Compare Qualitative and Quantitative needs
* Are there similar trends?
* Is there an actual issue?
* Will technology help or hurt the needs?

### 4. Design solution for needs
* Create a hypothesis
* Create a tech solution to test feasibility
* Quantitatively evaluate solution
* Try to find a simpler solution, but must still address root cause

### 5. Run real-world trial
* Create a process for the solution
* Follow process
* Collect qualitative data from participants
* Collect quantitative data from technology
* Iterate based on feedback

### 6. Compile report
* Analyze Qualitative and Quantitative data.
* Test hypothesis
* Write report
