# Overview
## Beginning
This ideas was created by James Benjamin Harris September, 2018.  He was in a meeting with execs who were talking about their problems and he thought, "I can us CV to solve the nuisance abatement issue".  An e-mail introducing his research was sent on September 25, 2018.

On November 2nd, 2018, a demo meeting was setup with Working in Neighborhoods to show James Benjamin Harris's research.

On July 25th, 2019 the first public project was kicked-off and a public git project was created without license, with attribution to James Benjamin Harris(Ben).

Following the City and under the guidance from City legal, the research seen in this repo was performed from scratch(no copyright material taken from the City) under the guidance of Harvard Innovation Labs.

## Simplest Solution
The results show a complex problem.  The simplest solution is to send out a certified letter ($5) for each reported issue. However, from a city management perspective it will be unclear if there are actual issues and thus a high false positive rate.  While this would reduce a budget, it is not a high quality, trustworthy solution.

## AI
Computer vision has significant potential to further reduce the time in the field. With our 360 camera and much more data we expect the reactive and proactive review rates to go beyond 90%.  This would further reduce the time in the field by an additional 25%.  The maximum we expect to reduce the time in the field by is around 83.5%.  Our small budget of $12,000 wasn't enough to collect and annotate large amounts of data, but it was enough to show the efficacy of the approach.

## Fairness
All decisions would be human supervised, helping to make the model less biased and as fair as possible.  Without proper oversight, it could reinforce systemic issues. Fairness would need to be defined and monitored by a governing body in each city.

## Community and Social Good
While focusing on social good and community is important, reducing the noise allows for more focused time on the complex human issues.  Based on one cities data, 67% of the issues are resolved after one warning.  Why focus time equally, when a small percentage of issues are related to the human dilemma.

## Driving Costs and ROI
While driving an entire city seems like a lot of work, the  workforce required to collect data every two weeks is a very small percentage of a neighborhood management budget.  We propose up to three four-hour shifts(night or day depending on traffic) to collect the data. From our testing, four hours was the max safe driving time.  Having two vehicles driving twelve hours a day, five days a week, costs a city around $12,000 in salary a month.  This sums to a total of $144,000 a year for a city the size of Tulsa, about 12% of their neighborhood budget.  This allows a taxpayer savings of around 40%, amounting to an annual savings of close to $480,000 for a city the size of Tulsa. We expect with more data and our 360 camera this savings to increase to around $750,000 annually.

## Benefits
Having an exhaustive set of data provides more benefits than 51.7% reduced time in the field, it also allows for numerous other applications such as engineering, road, air quality, and more.

## Privacy
Collecting monthly or bi-weekly allows the data to be specific, but not too specific. The nefarious applications are limited.  In addition, pii will be removed from the videos, increasing safety.  While there is still risk, proper processes and a governing body would significantly guard privacy.

## Legal
Consulted attorneys agree that street-view data is public in nature.  Anyone has the right to take a photo or video from a public road.  Otherwise, Google would have issues.
