If you had access to a service similar to google street view, except the images were updated every few weeks, how would you use this service?

Answer: Well, I don’t know. We use it today, getting an eyeball on their street. When a customer is reporting an issue with a streetlight and then we look at google street view to determine where a light is located. Reporting things like utility boxes allows us to make a determination of who owns it.
