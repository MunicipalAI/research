Securing qualitative interviews with C-level executives within municipalities proved challenging. Despite a relatively small sample size, our study revealed a significant overlap in both qualitative and quantitative results. This convergence suggests consistent issues across 30+ cities, indicating a broader challenge that extends beyond individual municipalities.

During our interviews, we observed disparities between 311 calls and leaders' priorities. This is a natural outcome of political dynamics, where leaders may prioritize high-impact projects over the careful allocation of resources. This tension between public visibility and responsible fiscal management is a common theme, driven by the imperative of re-election.

When we inquired about the use of mapping services, many leaders indicated familiarity with existing services and expressed openness to a more proactive solution. Interestingly, 311 calls emerged as a more direct expression of community needs, each carrying an associated cost (see section four for estimated costs per service).

Our comprehensive analysis of qualitative data, coupled with insights from 311 calls, guided the identification of essential data points. This process instilled confidence in the potential market and value of a solution addressing these widespread municipal challenges, benefiting both taxpayers and local governments.

In conclusion, our study unveils a mix of significant and common issues across municipalities, providing a foundation for the systematic collection of data. This data-driven approach, coupled with a focus on practical solutions, positions our findings as a valuable resource for municipalities seeking to address challenges efficiently and effectively.
